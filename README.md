**OpenXJarvis** (OpenClaw Python and Beyond) is a complete Python port of OpenClaw, connecting messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) with AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini). Built with Python's strengths for clarity and maintainability—because Python's what you need to get through!

## 🚧 Current Status

**✅ Working Now:**
- Telegram channel integration (fully operational)
- Core agent runtime with tool execution
- 24 built-in tools (file operations, web search, bash, etc.)
- 56+ skills for specialized tasks
- Workspace management with personality files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, etc.)
- Multi-model support (Claude, GPT, Gemini)

**🔨 Coming Soon (J.A.R.V.I.S Evolution):**
- Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp channels
- Web Control UI
- Cron scheduler
- Voice integration
- Advanced automation features

## ✨ Features (still not completed, but closer)

- 🤖 **Multi-Model Support**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Ollama
- 💬 **Multi-Channel**: Telegram ✅ (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp coming soon)
- ⏰ **Cron Scheduler**: Set reminders, recurring tasks ("wake me at 7am", "daily stock update")
- 🔧 **24+ Built-in Tools**: File ops, web search, bash, browser automation, memory search
- 🎓 **56+ Skills**: Modular extensions for specialized knowledge and workflows
- 🌐 **Web Control UI**: Browser-based interface (in development)
- 🔐 **Security**: Comprehensive permission management and sandboxing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (3.12+ recommended)
- **uv** package manager
- At least one LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google Gemini)
- **For Telegram:** A bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)

### Installation

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/openxjarvis/openclaw-python.git
cd openclaw-python

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Configuration

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your API keys:**
   ```bash
   # Required: At least one AI model provider
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
   # OR
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   # OR
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key-here

   # Required for Telegram
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
   ```

3. **Run initial setup:**
   ```bash
   uv run openclaw onboard
   ```
   
   This creates your configuration file at `~/.openclaw/config.json` and sets up your workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace/`.

## 📝 Command Reference

### Starting the Gateway

```bash
# Start with Telegram (foreground)
uv run openclaw start --port 18789 --telegram

# The gateway will create workspace files on first run:
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md    - Agent personality
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md  - Operating instructions
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md   - Local tool configurations
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/USER.md    - User profile
# ~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md - Agent identity
```

### Managing the Gateway

```bash
# Check status
uv run openclaw gateway status

# Stop the gateway
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal, or use:
uv run openclaw cleanup --kill-all

# View logs (if running as service)
uv run openclaw gateway logs

# Clean up stuck ports
uv run openclaw cleanup
uv run openclaw cleanup --ports 18789,8080
```

### Channel Management

```bash
# List available channels
uv run openclaw channels list

# Currently only Telegram is operational
# Other channels are in development
```

### Cron Jobs (Coming Soon)

```bash
# List cron jobs
uv run openclaw cron list

# Note: Cron functionality is under development
```

### Configuration

```bash
# View current configuration
cat ~/.openclaw/config.json

# Edit workspace files
nano ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md
nano ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# If ports are stuck (error: address already in use)
uv run openclaw cleanup --kill-all

# Run diagnostics
uv run openclaw doctor

# Check gateway bootstrap logs
uv run openclaw start --port 18789 --telegram
# Look for: "Bootstrap complete: X steps, 0 errors"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenXJarvis follows a modular architecture:

```
openclaw/
├── agents/          # Core agent runtime and system prompt
│   ├── templates/   # Workspace file templates (SOUL.md, etc.)
│   └── tools/       # Built-in tools (24 tools)
├── channels/        # Communication channels
│   └── telegram/    # ✅ Ready
├── gateway/         # Gateway server and bootstrap
├── skills/          # Modular skills (56+ available)
├── config/          # Configuration management
└── cli/             # Command-line interface
```

### Workspace Structure

Your workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace/` contains:

- **SOUL.md** - Defines your agent's personality and values
- **AGENTS.md** - Operating instructions and conventions
- **TOOLS.md** - Tool-specific configurations
- **USER.md** - Your profile and preferences
- **IDENTITY.md** - Agent identity (name, emoji, avatar)
- **HEARTBEAT.md** - Periodic task checklist
- **BOOTSTRAP.md** - First-run initialization guide (auto-created, delete after use)

These files are injected into the agent's system prompt on each session start.

## 🤖 Using with Telegram

1. **Create a bot:**
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
   - Copy your bot token to `.env`

2. **Start the gateway:**
   ```bash
   uv run openclaw start --port 18789 --telegram
   ```

3. **Chat with your bot:**
   - Find your bot on Telegram (search for the username you created)
   - Send a message to start chatting
   - The agent has access to tools and can execute commands

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_agent.py

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint
uv run ruff check .
```
